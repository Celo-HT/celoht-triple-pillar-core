# CeloHT Governance Framework

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the governance structure of CeloHT to ensure clarity, accountability, legal compliance, and alignment with international best practices.

CeloHT governance is explicitly structured around **three foundational pillars**, executed exclusively through **Celo cUSD** and **Valora**, to eliminate regulatory ambiguity and operational risk.

The three pillars are:
1. Education
2. Agents
3. Reforestation

No activity outside these pillars is permitted.

## 2. Nature of CeloHT
CeloHT is a non-custodial, educational and ecosystem-support initiative built within the Celo ecosystem.

CeloHT operates under a **Money-Communication-Based (MCB) model**, strictly limited to facilitation and coordination functions, according to the jurisdiction(s) it follows.

CeloHT:
- Is not a bank
- Is not a custodial financial institution
- Does not hold or safeguard client funds
- Does not intermediate funds on its own balance sheet
- Does not issue financial products or guarantees

CeloHT may facilitate peer-to-peer value exchange **only through licensed third-party platforms** (including Valora and the Celo blockchain), where funds remain entirely outside CeloHT control.

All financial value remains on third-party platforms such as Valora and the Celo blockchain.

## 3. Foundational Pillars
All CeloHT activities are strictly limited to the following pillars and executed using **Celo cUSD** via **Valora** or approved non-custodial Celo wallets.

1. **Education**
   - Financial, digital, and blockchain literacy
   - Celo ecosystem education
   - No investment advice or trading signals

2. **Agents**
   - Community-based facilitators under the MCB model
   - Support onboarding to Valora and cUSD usage
   - No custody, no pooling, no guarantees

3. **Reforestation**
   - Environmental and climate impact initiatives
   - Transparent tracking of funded projects
   - No profit extraction

## 4. Governance Principles
CeloHT governance follows these principles:
- Community-led and decentralized decision-making
- Transparency and public documentation
- Accountability with strict role separation
- Compliance-first and risk-based approach
- Zero speculation and zero yield promises

## 5. Founder Role

**Johnny Dubic** is the **Founder of CeloHT**.

Founder role:
- Originator of the CeloHT vision and mission
- Contributor to strategy and ecosystem alignment
- Non-executive, non-custodial role

Limits:
- No unilateral decision-making authority
- No control over community governance
- No custody or control of funds
- Subject to the same governance rules as all participants

## 6. Decentralized Community Governance

CeloHT is governed by a **decentralized community**, not by a single individual or centralized authority.

Governance authority resides in:
- The CeloHT community
- Documented governance processes
- Open participation and transparent decision records

Community responsibilities:
- Approve or reject strategic proposals
- Validate governance updates
- Oversee operational committees
- Safeguard alignment with the three pillars

No individual, including the founder, may override community decisions.

## 7. Operational Committees
Operational committees execute community-approved decisions.

Responsibilities:
- Education programs
- Agent coordination
- Reforestation initiatives
- Technical and operational maintenance

Limits:
- Cannot modify governance rules
- Cannot custody or manage user funds
- Must report transparently to the community

## 8. Compliance & Risk Oversight
Independent and community-mandated oversight function.

Responsibilities:
- Monitor regulatory and legal exposure
- Review AML/KYC alignment
- Identify MSB or custodial risks
- Publish compliance and risk reports

Authority:
- May halt or flag activities that violate governance or create regulatory risk
- Operates independently of founder influence

## 9. Decision-Making Process
- Proposals are submitted openly to the community
- Decisions follow documented, transparent procedures
- Emergency actions must be justified, logged, and reviewed by the community

No decision may:
- Convert CeloHT into a custodial entity
- Enable fund holding or financial intermediation
- Circumvent governance or compliance rules

## 10. Financial Governance
All financial flows:
- Use **Celo cUSD only**
- Are executed via **Valora or approved non-custodial Celo wallets**
- Remain fully outside CeloHT custody

Funds are allocated strictly to the three pillars and are never used for lending, trading, speculation, or investment.

## 11. Agent Model Governance
Agents operate strictly as facilitators under the MCB framework.

Rules:
- No custody of user funds
- No pooling or aggregation of funds
- Transactions executed directly on third-party platforms
- Fees disclosed in advance, fixed, minimal, and jurisdiction-compliant
- Agents registered internally and monitored

All agent activity remains off CeloHT balance sheets.

## 12. Technology Governance
- Open-source-first approach
- Auditable and transparent codebase
- No private key custody by CeloHT
- APIs and SDKs designed as non-custodial by default

## 13. Conflict of Interest Policy
- Mandatory disclosure of conflicts
- No self-dealing or preferential treatment
- Violations subject to community sanctions or removal

## 14. Amendment Process
Governance amendments require:
- Written proposal
- Community review and approval
- Public documentation

No retroactive changes are permitted.

## 15. Dissolution Clause
If CeloHT ceases operations:
- No user funds are affected
- No assets are redistributed for profit
- Governance and technical documentation remain public

## 16. Legal Position
This governance framework does not create:
- A partnership
- A financial contract
- A regulated financial service

CeloHT operates strictly as a non-custodial, community-governed, educational and ecosystem-support initiative.
